This is the first of many Java side projects that
I plan to work on in the near future.

This is a small Java project where the user inputs
a word and the program outputs it in reversed form!
To make it cooler, I wanted to make the program using GUI.

Download both of the files, FirstProjectLaunchPage.java 
and FirstProjectNewWindow.java. Then put them in a folder,
and run them on your IDE or using using terminal. The 
FirstProjectLaunchPage.java creates a pop-up window leading
to FirstProjectNewWindow.java.

To open in a terminal, type in "cmd" into the location/address bar at the top of the window in your folder and press enter. Now terminal is open so type, "javac FirstProjectNewWindow.java" and press enter and then "javac FirstProjectLaunchPage.java" and press enter. Now to finally run the file, type, "java FirstProjectLaunchPage". Now the program will run.
