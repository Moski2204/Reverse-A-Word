This is the first of many java side projects that
I plan to work on in the near future.

This is a small Java project where I wanted to create
a program where the user enters a word and the word 
will be outputted in reversed form. To make it cooler
I wanted to make the program using GUI.

Download the FirstProjectLaunchPage.java file and run
it to explore the whole project. The FirstProjectNewWindow.java 
file also works on its own, but using FirstProjectLaunchPage.java 
creates a pop-up window leading to FirstProjectNewWindow.java.
