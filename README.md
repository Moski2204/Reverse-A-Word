This is a small Java GUI project where the user inputs
a word and the program outputs it in reversed form!

Download both of the files, FirstProjectLaunchPage.java 
and FirstProjectNewWindow.java. Then put them in a folder, and run 
them on your IDE or using using terminal. The  FirstProjectLaunchPage.java 
creates a pop-up window leading to FirstProjectNewWindow.java.

To open in a terminal, type in "cmd" into the location/address bar at the top of the window in your folder and press enter. Now terminal is open so type, "javac FirstProjectNewWindow.java" and press enter and then "javac FirstProjectLaunchPage.java" and press enter. Now to finally run the file, type, "java FirstProjectLaunchPage". Now the program will run.
